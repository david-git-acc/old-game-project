# old-game-project
Files for the video game I made some years ago using pygame.

The program itself is called **finalcopy.py**. The code is terrible, but that's not why I built the project. I wanted to create something for myself that I (_and others_) could use and enjoy.
There are a *lot* of bugs, but the game is still fairly enjoyable, at least for me. 

**If I made this project today, I would have**:
-Commented the code as I made it
-Used numpy for all arrays
-Used more functions to avoid having to copypaste code
-Used a program to construct the frames for art instead of making everything manually
-Restructured the code so it's easier to make new ships

The gamesave.txt file just saves the high score. If I made it today and the game grew to have more saved features, I definitely would've used Pandas. 

There are 3 main folders:

# art
This is where all of the art for the game is stored, including all of the individual frames. These frames will be used to visualise the animated game.
I created all of the art (with the exception of the background image) myself, but you are free to use them for your own projects if you want :)

# sound
Stores all of the sound, from the music to the projectiles to the explosions. None of this is my own work so be advised if you want to use it for your own projects.

# storage
Stores the previous iterations of the game, since I didn't know what git was back then and that was my best substitute.
